artscene retirement, but using it here would be a little too on the nose.
Back in the game after a couple of decades away, he's changing ASCII art gears
from his time in ACiD and Remorse and recalibrating them for Impure.

"[[1mvermileonhart[0m has] been into tech since I was a little kid, I've been
fiddling with computers all my life but my heart has always yearned for the
arts and any means of creative expression... sadly, I've never been good at
it, or couldn't find any medium that felt fulfilling.

But one particular night it came to me... ASCII art. I remembered my dad and
I playing in his old DOS computer, writing shit into terminals and getting
drawings made with text. And it was like an epiphany: I could make art that
was in my tech realm, and it would pay homage to those old days when I was a
kid and everything was alright. So I became obsessed with it... I started
looking for anything related to ASCII art, found out about BBSs, art packs...
all of that.

And that got me here."
